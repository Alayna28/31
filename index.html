            Pizza is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese,
            and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

            Pastry refers to a variety of doughs, as well as the sweet and savoury baked goods made from them. These goods are often
            called pastries as a synecdoche, and the dough may be accordingly called pastry dough for clarity. Sweetened pastries
            are often described as bakers' confectionery. Common pastry dishes include pies, tarts, quiches, croissants, and pasties.
